        <p class="creeper-description">A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and explodes. Due to their distinctive appearance and high potential for killing unwary players as well as damaging the environment and players' constructions, creepers have become one of the icons of Minecraft, both among players and non-players.</p>
        <p class="creeper-description">Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well as the only way to obtain most music discs. When struck by lightning, a creeper becomes charged, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained.</p>
